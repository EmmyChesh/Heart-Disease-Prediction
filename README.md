# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Objective:

Amongst all the organs, The heart is a significant part of our body. The heart beats about 2.5 billion times over the average lifetime, pushing millions of gallons of blood to every part of the body.
In this era, the heart disease is increasing day by day due to the modern lifestyle and food. The diagnosis of heart disease is a challenging task. This classification model will predict whether the patient has heart disease or not based on various conditions/symptoms of their body.

Data Description:
The dataset contains 13 independent features and 1 target feature as described below.

age
sex
cp (chest pain type) (4 values)
trestbps (resting blood pressure)
chol (serum cholestoral in mg/dl)
fbs (fasting blood sugar) > 120 mg/dl
restecg (resting electrocardiographic results) (values 0,1,2)
thalach (maximum heart rate achieved)
exang (exercise induced angina)
oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
ca - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
target - is the binary target variable, 0 indicates that the patient has heart disease, the value is 1 if not.
